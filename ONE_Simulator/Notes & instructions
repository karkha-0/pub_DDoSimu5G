To compile the code there are 3 compile files under the project
- compile.bat  -> original 
- compile_new.bat -> modified by me (look at change history to understand the changes)
- compile_withWarning.bat -> compiles while ignoring warnings (look at change history to understand the changes)

To run you need to use:
- ./one.sh sim_Scenario/D2D_pro_sim.txt (the simulaiton configuration can be any file you create)

To run without GUI:
The script is ONE_Simulator/the-one-1.6.0/one_noGUI.sh
